# PTC2-Microbiome Repository

## Project: Snail Hemolymph Microbiome Differs Between Genotypes in a Genomic Region Associated with Resistance to Parasite Infection
This repository contains all R code and workflows used to analyze and visualize the *Biomphalaria glabrata* hemolymph and tank water microbial data.

## Project Overview
This project analyses the hemolymph and tank water microbiome of BS90 _Biomphalaria glabrata_ snails using 16S rDNA sequencing data. Data was processed in R following the DADA2 and microViz pipelines. Downstread analyses and figure generation was conducted in R. The goal of this project was to assess differences in microbial abundance and presence between resistant and susceptible inbred snail lines fixed at a genomic marker, the _PTC2_, that has additional roles in snail susceptibility to schistosome infection.
